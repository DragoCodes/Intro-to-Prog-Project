# FaceDontLie
## Introduction to programming - ID1110
## Project
In this Project we have made an application which will capture our faces and detect our emotion in live feed as well as in a previously taken picture.

We have used the dataset "Face expression recognition dataset" by JONATHAN OHEIX which can be accessed using this link- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset

For creating the GUI, we have used QT Designer
