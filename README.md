## Project

### Brief Introduction
In this Project we have made an application which will capture our faces and detect our emotion in live feed as well as in a previously taken picture.

We have used the dataset "Face expression recognition dataset" by JONATHAN OHEIX which can be accessed using this link-
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset

The Application uses a particular model 'model_weights.h5' which has been trained by the 'training.py' file using the above mentioned dataset

When we give the live feed of the webcam or a particular photo. The application predicts the emotion using the trained model.

For creating the GUI, we have used QT Designer
